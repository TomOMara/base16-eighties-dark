# base16-eighties-dark Color Scheme for Sublime Text

This is a color scheme for [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com) based on [tyre's Atom adaptation](https://github.com/tyre/base16-eighties-dark) of [Chris Kempson's Base 16 Eighties Theme](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/).

This color scheme was modified with Ruby/Rails in mind. I use it with the excelent [Spacegray](https://github.com/kkga/spacegray) UI theme.
